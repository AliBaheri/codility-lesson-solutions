My solutions to Codility's online coding challenges
==================================================

All challenges will be sorted into the appropriate lessons, exactly like how codility organizes them.

Lesson 1: Time Complexity
------------------------
TapeEquilibrium
* Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.

FrogJmp
* Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

PermMissingElem
* Find the missing element in a given permutation. 


Lesson 2: Counting Elements
---------------------------
FrogRiverOne
* Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.

PermCheck
* Check whether array A is a permutation.

MissingInteger
* Find the minimal positive integer not occuring in a given sequence.

MaxCounters
* Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.


Lesson 3: Prefix Sums
--------------------
CountDiv
* Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b].

PassingCars
* Count the number of passing cars on the road.

MinAvgTwoSlice
* Find the minimal average of any slice containing at least two elements.

GenomicRangeQuery
* Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA.


Lesson 4: Sorting
-----------------
MaxProductOfThree
* Maximize A[P]\*A[Q]\*A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R).


Distinct
* Compute number of distinct values in an array.
